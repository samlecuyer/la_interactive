## Welcome to Los Angeles.

LA is the second largest city in the country and home to some of its
most memorable landmarks.

If you're unfamiliar with LA, this guide should help understand its basic
geography and features.

Use your keyboard to navigate in the directions indicated by the arrows below.

##Firstly, it's huge.

At 503 square miles, it's more than twice the size of Chicago.  North to South, it spans 55 miles.  US Cellular Field is closer to Wisconsin than that.

It contains multiple mountain ranges, completely envelopes other cities.  3.9 million people live within the city limits, 13.1 million in the metro area.

The city ranges from beaches to 5,074 ft above sea level.  Mt Baldy, at 10,064 ft, is in the national park just outside city limits.

##Secondly, LA is more than just the city limits.

LA County is over 4,700 square miles.  That's larger than Delaware and Rhode Island combined and only slightly smaller than Connecticut.  

A lot of what people call LA is actually outside of the city limits.  I'll try to distinguish between what is in the city, what is in the county, and what is in the metro area.

##Some Basic Geography

LA is largely seated in a basin that's bordered by the Santa Monica Bay on the south-west and mountains on all sides.
		                    </script>
		                </section>
		                <section data-markdown data-map="bay">
                    		<script type="text/template">
##The Bay

Santa Monica Bay is usually delimeted by Point Dume in Malibu in the north and the Palos Verdes Peninsula in the south.

The coastline of the bay is nearly 50 miles long.
		                    </script>

		                <section data-markdown data-map="point-dume">
                    		<script type="text/template">
##Point Dume

Point Dume is a pretty famous beach where Charlton Heston made some shocking realizations in Planet of the Apes.

![planet of the apes finale](images/planet-of-the-apes.jpeg)

It's been in plenty of other movies too.

                    		<script type="text/template">
##Palos Verdes

Palos Verdes is known for its beautiful cliffs, horse trails, and expensive homes.

![planet of the apes finale](images/palos-verdes.jpg)

The [Wayfarer's Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayfarers_Chapel) (Frank Lloyd Wright) is there as well.

                    		<script type="text/template">
##Channel Islands

Outside of the bay are the Channel Islands.  Catalina Island is probably the most famous.  LA County has 2 Channel Islands.  San Clemente is used by the military.

The Channel Islands are technically an underwater mountain range, and the Palos Verdes Peninsula is formed as the landed-end of the same range.

##Where in LA are you from?

The LA Times has done a fantastic job of breaking LA into 16 regions encompassing 114 neighborhoods, 158 cities, and 42 unincorporated areas.  

Each area has its own culture and reputation and asking one where in LA they're from is the correct response to "I'm from LA".

Seriously, we're a little strange that way.  Just ask.

	                    		<script type="text/template">
##South Bay
Let's start with the South Bay area, since I live there.

South Bay is a culturally, ethnically, and economically diverse area comprised of two neighborhoods of LA and 17 other cities.  It blends beach towns with industrial areas and suburbs to give the region a distinctive feel not found anywhere else in LA.

The historic home of Southern California's aerospace industry, this region of LA is home to a lot of engineers and defense contractors.  Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and SpaceX are all conveniently located around the home of Los Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo.

	                    		<script type="text/template">
##Westchester

This is where I live.

Westchester is home to LMU and Otis College of Art and Design.  LAX occupies the southern half of the neighborhood.

The northern border of Westchester is a bluff, giving a great view of the Basin.  On a clear day you can see the Hollywood Sign.

	                    		<script type="text/template">
##El Segundo

Literally meaning "The Second", this town is named after Standard Oil's (Chevron's, now) second refinery on the west coast.

It is also the home of Los Angeles Air Force Base and a number of aerospace companies.  Tesla and SpaceX are in neighboring Hawthorne.

Despite the industry, El Segundo keeps an amazing small-town feel in its historic downtown district.

##The Beach Cities

Manhattan, Hermosa, and Redondo make up the "Beach Cities" of South Bay.

Although El Segundo and Torrance also have beach access, these three cities have notable piers.

![redondo beach pier](images/redondo-pier.jpg)<br>

	                    		<script type="text/template">
##Torrance

LA Weekly once called Torrance "essentially Japan's 48th prefecture".  It has the second largest concentration of ethnic Japanese in the US behind Honolulu.

It is also home to South Bay's automotive industry.  Honda and Toyota both have US headquarters in Torrance.

In addition, Torrance contains many excellent microbreweries.  I'll go so far as to say the best beer brewed in LA is brewed in Torrance.

##Palos Verdes

Palos Verdes Estates, Rancho Palos Verdes, Rolling Hills, and Rolling Hills Estates make up the Palos Verdes Peninsula.

In 2005, Forbes ranked all of these among the most expensive zip codes in the nation.

The peninsula is also home to Trump National Golf Club and was the film site of the 'Port Charles' scenes in Pirates of the Carribean.

Outside of LA, Inglewood is probably best known for Randy's Donuts and the Forum, where the Lakers played until they moved Downtown in 1999.

##Getting Around

At this point, we'll take a break from the neighborhoods to talk about how we get between them.
Public transit in LA is notoriously poor, so everyone drives.

We love our freeways, we love hating our freeways, and we love prepending 'the' to their numbers.

There are plenty of freeways in LA, but we'll only talk about the half-dozen major freeways.  These freeways are mostly long and are clipped for reasonability.

	                    		<script type="text/template">
##Pacific Coast Highway	

"SR-1", "PCH", "Coast Highway".  It has so many names.

PCH follows the coast from the southern edge of Orange County all the way up to San Francisco.  It's not a freeway.  It's not more than 2 lanes in each direction.  But it's a landmark of California in its own right.

##The 5	

I-5 is *the* interstate on the west coast.  It runs from Mexico to Canada, but in LA its main use is to connect Downtown with Orange County & Santa Clarita.

Traffic on the 5 is awful.

##The 101

The 101 connects Downtown with the Valley, and also goes up the coast to the Bay Area.

##The 405

The 405 is the 5's western bypass route, and it's how everyone on the Westside gets around.  It connects the San Fernando Valley to Orange County staying closer to the coast.  

Because it runs through some of the most affordable areas to live and the most popular places to work, it's one of the busiest freeways in California.

Occasionally they close it, resulting in what locals call "Car-mageddon".

![oj bronco chase](images/white-bronco.jpg)<br>
It's been on TV a few times.

Traffic on the 405 is awful.

##The 10

The 10 is another busy freeway coming from the Westside.  It's the major connector between Downtown and Santa Monica.

If you keep going east, it'll take you to Florida.

##The 110

The 110 connects Downtown to the Harbor and is called 'Harbor Freeway'.

It's also the freeway featured in the 1994 classic 'Speed'.

![actual bus jumping](images/speed-bus.jpg)

The famous jumping scene was at the 110/105 interchange, which was actually under construction at the time.

##The 105

Once on the 105, Sandra Bullock took the 105 to LAX so she could crash the bus.

The 90 is not a busy freeway.  It was supposed to go from the Marina to Orange County,
but the communities in the middle blocked it and it was left as a 3 mile spur to the 405.

Okay, back to neighborhoods.

Harbor is, surprisingly, the area surrounding Port of Los Angeles.

It also contains Catalina Island, since the ferry departs from the port.

Catalina is one of the Channel Islands.  It is mostly a nature conservancy.
Avalon, its only incorporated city, is a small resort town.

It's a popular place to go for hiking and scuba diving.

The island used to be owned by the Wrigleys, and was the home of the Chicago Cubs spring training from 1921 to 1951.

San Pedro is the home of the Port of Los Angeles, the largest container port in the Western Hemisphere.

Roughly $1.2B of goods come through the port every day.

The port itself is on an artificial island, and the Vincent Thomas Bridge connects it to the mainland.

##Harbor Gateway

Harbor Gateway, Harbor City, and Wilmington are all neighborhoods in LA that were annexed as a result of a lawsuit against Collis Huntington & Southern Pacific Railroad in 1896.  

Huntington had created his own port in Santa Monica and was attempting to monopolize frieght in Los Angeles.  The city sued, won, and built its own port in San Pedro, annexing 16 miles of land on the way to keep the port within city limits.

Long Beach is the seventh largest city in California and home to the second largest shipping port in the country.

That's right.  Immediately next to the largest port in the country is the second largest port.

It's home to The Aquarium of the Pacific, the best Aquarium in Southern California.
