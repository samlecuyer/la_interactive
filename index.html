## Welcome to Los Angeles.

LA is the second largest city in the country and home to some of its
most memorable landmarks.

If you're unfamiliar with LA, this guide should help understand its basic
geography and features.

Use your keyboard to navigate in the directions indicated by the arrows below.

##Firstly, it's huge.

At 503 square miles, it's more than twice the size of Chicago.  North to South, it spans 55 miles.  US Cellular Field is closer to Wisconsin than that.

It contains multiple mountain ranges, completely envelopes other cities.  3.9 million people live within the city limits, 13.1 million in the metro area.

The city ranges from beaches to 5,074 ft above sea level.  Mt Baldy, at 10,064 ft, is in the national park just outside city limits.

##Secondly, LA is more than just the city limits.

LA County is over 4,700 square miles.  That's larger than Delaware and Rhode Island combined and only slightly smaller than Connecticut.  

A lot of what people call LA is actually outside of the city limits.  I'll try to distinguish between what is in the city, what is in the county, and what is in the metro area.

##Some Basic Geography

LA is largely seated in a basin that's bordered by the Santa Monica Bay on the south-west and mountains on all sides.

		                <section data-markdown data-map="bay">
                    		<script type="text/template">
##The Bay

Santa Monica Bay is usually delimeted by Point Dume in Malibu in the north and the Palos Verdes Peninsula in the south.

The coastline of the bay is nearly 50 miles long.

                    		<script type="text/template">
##Point Dume

Point Dume is a pretty famous beach where Charlton Heston made some shocking realizations in Planet of the Apes.

![planet of the apes finale](images/planet-of-the-apes.jpeg)

It's been in plenty of other movies too.

                    		<script type="text/template">
##Palos Verdes

Palos Verdes is known for its beautiful cliffs, horse trails, and expensive homes.

![planet of the apes finale](images/palos-verdes.jpg)

The [Wayfarer's Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayfarers_Chapel) (Frank Lloyd Wright) is there as well.

                    		<script type="text/template">
##Channel Islands

Outside of the bay are the Channel Islands.  Catalina Island is the largest and most famous.  LA County has 2 Channel Islands.  San Clemente is used by the military.

The Channel Islands are technically an underwater mountain range, and the Palos Verdes Peninsula is formed as the landed-end of the same range.

##Where in LA are you from?

The LA Times has done a fantastic job of breaking LA into 16 regions encompassing 114 neighborhoods, 158 cities, and 42 unincorporated areas.  

Each area has its own culture and reputation and asking one where in LA they're from is the correct response to "I'm from LA".

Seriously, we're a little strange that way.  Just ask.

##South Bay
Let's start with the South Bay area, since I live there.

South Bay is a culturally, ethnically, and economically diverse area comprised of two neighborhoods of LA and 17 other cities.  It blends beach towns with industrial areas and suburbs to give the region a distinctive feel not found anywhere else in LA.

The historic home of Southern California's aerospace industry, this region of LA is home to a lot of engineers and defense contractors.  Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and SpaceX are all conveniently located around the home of Los Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo.

	                    		<script type="text/template">
##Westchester

This is where I live.

Westchester is home to LMU and Otis College of Art and Design.  LAX occupies the southern half of the neighborhood.

The northern border of Westchester is a bluff, giving a great view of the Basin.  On a clear day you can see the Hollywood Sign.

	                    		<script type="text/template">
##El Segundo

Literally meaning "The Second", this town is named after Standard Oil's (Chevron's, now) second refinery on the west coast.

It is also the home of Los Angeles Air Force Base and a number of aerospace companies.  Tesla and SpaceX are in neighboring Hawthorne.

Despite the industry, El Segundo keeps an amazing small-town feel in its historic downtown district.

##The Beach Cities

Manhattan, Hermosa, and Redondo make up the "Beach Cities" of South Bay.

Although El Segundo and Torrance also have beach access, these three cities have notable piers.

	                    		<script type="text/template">
##Torrance

LA Weekly once called Torrance "essentially Japan's 48th prefecture".  It has the second largest concentration of ethnic Japanese in the US behind Honolulu.

It is also home to South Bay's automotive industry.  Honda and Toyota both have US headquarters in Torrance.

In addition, Torrance contains many excellent microbreweries.  I'll go so far as to say the best beer brewed in LA is brewed in Torrance.

	                    		<script type="text/template">
##Palos Verdes

Palos Verdes Estates, Rancho Palos Verdes, Rolling Hills, and Rolling Hills Estates make up the Palos Verdes Peninsula.

In 2005, Forbes ranked all of these among the most expensive zip codes in the nation.

The peninsula is also home to Trump National Golf Club and was the film site of the 'Port Charles' scenes in Pirates of the Carribean.

##Inglewood

Outside of LA, Inglewood is probably best known for Randy's Donuts and the Forum, where the Lakers played until they moved Downtown in 1999.
