## Welcome to Los Angeles.

LA is the second largest city in the country and home to some of its
most memorable landmarks.

If you're unfamiliar with LA, this guide should help understand its basic
geography and features.

Use your keyboard to navigate in the directions indicated by the arrows below.

                    		<script type="text/template">
##Firstly, it's huge.

At 503 square miles, it's more than twice the size of Chicago.  North to South, it spans 55 miles.  US Cellular Field is closer to Wisconsin than that.

It contains multiple mountain ranges, completely envelopes other cities.  3.9 million people live within the city limits, 13.1 million in the metro area.

The city ranges from beaches to 5,074 ft above sea level.  Mt Baldy, at 10,064 ft, is in the national park just outside city limits.

##Secondly, LA is more than just the city limits.

LA County is over 4,700 square miles.  That's larger than Delaware and Rhode Island combined and only slightly smaller than Connecticut.  

A lot of what people call LA is actually outside of the city limits.  I'll try to distinguish between what is in the city, what is in the county, and what is in the metro area.

##Some Basic Geography

LA is largely seated in a basin that's bordered by the Santa Monica Bay on the south-west and mountains on all sides.
		                    </script>
		                </section>
		                <section data-markdown data-map="bay">
                    		<script type="text/template">
##The Bay

Santa Monica Bay is usually delimeted by Point Dume in Malibu in the north and the Palos Verdes Peninsula in the south.

The coastline of the bay is nearly 50 miles long.
		                    </script>

		                <section data-markdown data-map="point-dume">
                    		<script type="text/template">
##Point Dume

Point Dume is a pretty famous beach where Charlton Heston made some shocking realizations in Planet of the Apes.

![planet of the apes finale](images/planet-of-the-apes.jpeg)

It's been in plenty of other movies too.

                    		<script type="text/template">
##Palos Verdes

Palos Verdes is known for its beautiful cliffs, horse trails, and expensive homes.

![planet of the apes finale](images/palos-verdes.jpg)

                    		<script type="text/template">
##Channel Islands

Outside of the bay are the Channel Islands.  Catalina Island is probably the most famous.  LA County has 2 Channel Islands.  San Clemente is used by the military.

The Channel Islands are technically an underwater mountain range, and the Palos Verdes Peninsula is formed as the landed-end of the same range.

                    		<script type="text/template">
##Surrounding Counties

Los Angeles County is bordered by 4 neighboring counties, but the expanse of LA mostly only spills into Ventura County to the northwest and Orange County to the south.

                    		<script type="text/template">
##Where in LA are you from?

The LA Times has done a fantastic job of breaking LA into 16 regions encompassing 114 neighborhoods, 158 cities, and 42 unincorporated areas.  

Each area has its own culture and reputation and asking one where in LA they're from is the correct response to "I'm from LA".

Seriously, we're a little strange that way.  Just ask.

                    		<script type="text/template">
##Getting Around

Before we get into the regions, let's take a minute to talk about getting between them.
Public transit in LA is notoriously poor, so everyone drives everywhere.

We love our freeways, we love hating our freeways, and we love prepending 'the' to their numbers.

If you've ever seen the SNL bit *The Californians*, you'll know that Angelenos love to talk about which roads to take to get anywhere.  So let's take the roads through LA as a guide between the parts of the city.

                    		<script type="text/template">
##Pacific Coast Highway	

Let's start with "The 1", "PCH", "Coast Highway".  It has so many names.

PCH follows the coast from the southern edge of Orange County all the way up to San Francisco.  It's not a freeway.  It's not more than 2 lanes in each direction.  But it's a landmark of California in its own right.

We'll start up in Malibu and work our way down the coast.

##Santa Monica Mountains

To be clear, no part of this region is within the City of Los Angeles.

Largely affluent and extremely white, this is a region defined by beautiful beaches and gated communities.

With the mountains running through the middle, Malibu defines the southern edge with the other communities in the hills on the northern edge.

##Malibu  

Malibu is one of the most famous beach towns in the country.

This thin strip of land contains 21 miles of beach, though the town signs claim 27 for historic reasons.

![malibu city sign](images/malibu-sign.jpeg)<br>
<small>Malibu is only 21 miles long (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu,_California#/media/File:Malibu,_Western_Malibu,_(Californie).jpeg">wikipedia</a>)</small>

The most expensive part of town costs an estimated $200K per foot of beach.

Beaches in Malibu include Surfrider Beach, Zuma Beach, and Point Dume Beach.

Zuma Beach is the home of LA's annual Polar Bear Plunge.

Malibu Creek State Park is used to film a lot of movies and TV shows.

Topanga is largely known for its bohemian, <del>hippie</del> artistic community.  

During the 1960s, is was a popular place for new artists.
Neil Young recorded his famous *After the Gold Rush* album here.

From 1967 until 2002, Topanga Canyon was also home to a famous nudist club.

##The Westside

The Westside of LA is a largely affluent area covering the north end of the bay.  The hills to the north separate it from The Valley and the incredibly low vaccination rate separate it from the rest of reality.

Apart from Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, and Culver City, the Westside is entirely neighborhoods within the City of Los Angeles.

The Westside is home to many of LA's more famous pop culture references.

##Pacific Palisades

Pacific Palisades is an affluent district in the Westside.
It is frequently used in TV and movies.

Curb Your Enthusiasm is filmed here, Baywatch was filmed here, Saved by the Bell was set here.

It was the home of oil magnate JP Getty and remains home to the Getty Villa, the smaller of the two Getty art museums in LA.

##Brentwood

Brentwood is a large and affluent neighborhood, having one of the lowest population densities in the city.

Outside of LA, you might hear of Brentwood because Nicole Brown was murdered here.

Brentwood is home to the other half of the Getty Trust, the Getty Center.

Perched in the Santa Monica mountains, it is visible from much of the basin.

<small>The Getty Center (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Paul_Getty_Museum#/media/File:Aerial_Getty_Museum.jpg">wikipedia</a>)</small>

##Platinum Triangle

The city of Beverly Hills and neighborhoods of Bel Air and Holmby Hills form what's known as the Platinum Triangle.  (Westwood is highlighted, Holmby Hills is its northeastern corner)

Known for its opulent displays of wealth, this is a popular place for movie stars and producers.

##Beverly Crest

Beverly Crest is another affluent neighborhood up the hills from Beverly Hills.  It's mostly narrow, winding canyon roads with unmarked signs and gates.

It's a bad place to leave your wife in a house you rented from a producer who may have slighted Charles Manson.

##Westwood

Westwood is considered one of LA's wealthiest neighborhoods.  It is home to UCLA, the Los Angeles Country Club, and Holmby Hills.

Holmby Hills might not be the most famous name and its sights are frequently confused with Beverly Hills.

Walt Disney, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Armand Hammer, Casey Kasem all lived here.  The Playboy Mansion is  located in here.

Also notable is Aaron Spelling's *The Manor*.  Over 55,000 sq. feet, this private residence is larger than the White House.  Listed in 2009 for $150M, it was the most expensive real estate listing in the country.

##Santa Monica

Santa Monica is a fair-sized beach town.

Before its renumbering in 1985, Route 66 ended at PCH in Santa Monica.  Route 66 followed what is now SR-2, or what Cheryl Crow calls "san-ta-mo-ni-ca-bou-le-vaaaard".

It's home to Universal Music, Lionsgate, Viacom, and others.  Part of Silicon Beach, it's also home to hundreds of tech startups.

The famous Santa Monica Pier has been featured in numerous movies. "The Incline" stretch of PCH was used in the ending of *It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World* (though the W was in Palos Verdes).

##Venice

Venice is a neighborhood of LA that was developed to be a tiny replica of Venice, Italy.

It was built and founded in 1905 as a city by a tobacco mogal, but by 1925 its local politics had collapsed and it voted to be annexed by LA.

It is known for its canals, its boardwalk, and its charming weirdos.

Part of Silicon Beach, Venice is home to Google's LA office and many tech startups.

##Playa Vista

Playa Vista was originally developed as the headquarters of Hughes Aircraft.  The Spruce Goose was built here before being moved to Long Beach for its only flight.

Since being sold, it has been converted into a planned town with $1M+ condos.  This sparked controversy when the developers accidentally dup up an ancient Tongva Indian burial ground and had to rebury it outside of their development.

Part of Silicon Beach, Playa is home to Yahoo, Youtube, Microsoft, ICANN, EA, Belkin, and Facebook offices.

##Marina Del Rey

Marina Del Rey is an unincorporated community in LA County, and the largest man-made small craft harbor.  It contains 19 separate marinas and can house up to 5,300 boats.  It's also home to several restaurants and condominium highrises.

Amazingly, an unobstructed view of the ocean can be found for around $400k, if you're willing to pay an extra $1,700/mo in land lease fees.

Although set in Newport, Arrested Development's boardwalk scenes were filmed at Marina Del Rey.

Culver City, unlike all other neighborhoods called "City" so far, is a city.

Culver City is probably most famous these days for being the location of Sony Pictures.  Hundreds of movies have been produced in Culver City.
*Wizard of Oz*, *Gone with the Wind*, *ET*, *The Andy Griffith Show* were all filmed in Culver City.

##The 90

This little tilde of a freeway cost the state $30.8M in 1959.

It was intended to be a full-sized freeway from Marina Del Rey to Yorba Linda.
Unfortunately, that didn't work out, so now it's a minor spur for the 405 from PCH.

It's 4 lanes wide in each direction.
It's 3.28 miles long.

##The 405

The 405 is the 5's western bypass route, and it's how the Westside gets around.  It's much faster to get down around than on PCH.

It connects the San Fernando Valley, the Westside, South Bay, and The Harbor.

Because it runs through some of the most affordable areas to live and the most popular places to work, it's one of the busiest freeways in California.

![oj bronco chase](images/white-bronco.jpg)<br>
It's been on TV a few times.

Traffic on the 405 is awful.

##South Bay
Hey, I live here!

South Bay is a culturally, ethnically, and economically diverse area comprised of two neighborhoods of LA and 17 other cities.  It blends beach towns with industrial areas and suburbs to give the region a distinctive feel not found anywhere else in LA.

The historic home of Southern California's aerospace industry, this region of LA is home to a lot of engineers and defense contractors.  Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and SpaceX are all conveniently located around the home of Los Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo.

##Westchester

This is where I live.

Westchester is home to LMU and Otis College of Art and Design.  LAX occupies the southern half of the neighborhood.

The northern border of Westchester is a bluff, giving a great view of the Basin.  On a clear day you can see the Hollywood Sign.

##El Segundo

Literally meaning "The Second", this town is named after Standard Oil's (Chevron's, now) second refinery on the west coast.

It is also the home of Los Angeles Air Force Base and a number of aerospace companies.  Tesla and SpaceX are in neighboring Hawthorne.

Despite the industry, El Segundo keeps an amazing small-town feel in its historic downtown district.

LA Weekly once called Torrance "essentially Japan's 48th prefecture".  It has the second largest concentration of ethnic Japanese in the US behind Honolulu.

It is also home to South Bay's automotive industry.  Honda and Toyota both have US headquarters in Torrance.

In addition, Torrance contains many excellent microbreweries.  I'll go so far as to say the best beer brewed in LA is brewed in Torrance.

Palos Verdes Estates, Rancho Palos Verdes, Rolling Hills, and Rolling Hills Estates make up the Palos Verdes Peninsula.

In 2005, Forbes ranked all of these among the most expensive zip codes in the nation.

The peninsula is also home to Trump National Golf Club and was the film site of the 'Port Charles' scenes in Pirates of the Carribean.

Catalina is one of the Channel Islands.  It is mostly a nature conservancy.
Avalon, its only incorporated city, is a small resort town.

It's a popular place to go for hiking and scuba diving.

The island used to be owned by the Wrigleys, and was the home of the Chicago Cubs spring training from 1921 to 1951.

San Pedro is the home of the Port of Los Angeles, the largest container port in the Western Hemisphere.

Roughly $1.2B of goods come through the port every day.

The port itself is on an artificial island, and the Vincent Thomas Bridge connects it to the mainland.

![vincent thomas bridge](images/vincent-thomas.jpg)<br>

##Harbor Gateway

Harbor Gateway, Harbor City, and Wilmington are all neighborhoods in LA that were annexed as a result of a lawsuit against Collis Huntington & Southern Pacific Railroad in 1896.  

Huntington had created his own port in Santa Monica and was attempting to monopolize frieght in Los Angeles.  The city sued, won, and built its own port in San Pedro, annexing 16 miles of land on the way to keep the port within city limits.

Long Beach is the seventh largest city in California and home to the second largest shipping port in the country.

That's right.  Immediately next to the largest port in the country is the second largest port.

It's home to The Aquarium of the Pacific, the best Aquarium in Southern California.

Let's keep taking the freeways around LA.  The 110, *Harbor Freeway*, goes north from the port through Downtown.

##Angels Flight

Angels Flight is one of my favorite spots in LA.

It's a historic funicular railway that goes up and down Bunk Hill.

There's a park at the top called "Angels Knoll", which Joseph Gordon-Levitt erroneously calls "Angelus Plaza" in *500 Days of Summer*.  Angelus Plaza is a low-income retirement home, also on Bunker Hill.

##Finishing the City

Before we explore too many more surrounding areas, we've got one more major portion of the city to finish: San Fernando Valley

There are a few ways to get there, so let's take a look.  We'll have to head back down the 110 to Downtown.

##The 5

The 5 is *the freeway* of the west coast.  It runs from Mexico to Canada and goes through Downtown LA.

Taking it north will bring us through the eastern side of San Fernando Valley and on to Santa Clarita.

##The 101

The 101 will take us across the southern portion of The Valley, then down into the Santa Monica mountains before heading up the coast to San Francisco.

###The Valley

There are many valleys around Los Angeles.  There is only *one* The Valley.

##City of Industry

Yes, that's actually the name of the city.

I know what you're thinking: "Were the city limits defined by child trying to draw a dragon, or maybe a constellation?"  Almost.

Industry is a industrial city incorporated as a land grab to prevent other cities from annexing industrial areas for taxes.

Roughly 80,000 people work here, but only 219 people live here.  There is no business tax; city revenue comes from sales tax and property taxes.

Due of the small population & large amount of money, the politics of Industry are tied to a small, well-connected few and are of ill repute.
